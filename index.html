      In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is
      presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3]
      In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held
      in the hand. The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a
      Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the
      border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish
      and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It has
      become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food
      item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias
      (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean
      cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food.[5][6] Various food
      companies also sell ready-baked frozen pizzas in grocery stores, to be
      reheated in an ordinary home oven. In 2017, the world pizza market was
      $128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000
      pizzerias.[7] Overall, 13% of the U.S. <br />
      population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[8] A
      Technomic study concluded that 83% of consumers eat pizza at least once
      per month. According to PMQ in 2018 60.47% of respondents reported an
      increase in sales over the previous year. [9] The Associazione Verace
      Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit
      organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to
      promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.[10] In 2009, upon Italy's request,
      Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional
      Speciality Guaranteed dish,[11][12] and in 2017 the art of its making was
      included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[13]
